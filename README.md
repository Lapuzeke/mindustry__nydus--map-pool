This repository is for submitting maps to the `mindustry.nydus.app` server.

Submit your maps using the pull request feature of github.

Rules:


     •Map has to be `.msav` file type.

     •Filename must be fairly similar to the ingame name of the map.

     •Please dont submit copies of the existing maps.

     •If you want to submit the built-in maps, add `[Built-in]` to your title.

Feel free to add (or remove) maps via pull requests based solely on your own opinion,  
do not be afraid to offend people with your own taste :slightly_smiling_face:  
(discussing them can happen in the pull request)

`also, this readme file looks horrible right now, so feel free to polish it up via a pull request as well` :no_mouth:
